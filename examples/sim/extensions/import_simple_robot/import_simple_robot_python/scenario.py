    The following two functions demonstrate the mechanics of running code in a script-like way

    The update() function is tied to a physics subscription, which means that it will be called
    one time on every physics step (usually 60 frames per second).  Each time it is called, it
    queries the script generator using next().  This makes the script generator execute until it hits
    a yield().  In this case, no value need be yielded.  This behavior can be nested into subroutines
    using the "yield from" keywords.
